//No, addTodo and removeTodo are not states. They are reducer functions or action handlers defined within the reducers object of the createSlice function.


//and now we are going to store ..

export default todoSlice.reducer



//In the context of Redux and Redux Toolkit, action.payload is a common way to pass data from an action to a reducer. Letâ€™s break down what it means and how it's used.

//What is action.payload?
//action: In Redux, an action is an object that describes what happened. It usually has a type property that specifies the type of action (like 'ADD_TODO', 'REMOVE_TODO', etc.).
//payload: The payload property of an action is where you store the data that you want to send to the reducer. This data is usually passed to the action creator when the action is dispatched.

//INDIVIDUAL REDUCERS:SO here addTodo And removeTodo are the individual reducers and todoSlice.reducer is the whole reducer
//and since we update state with the help of individual reducers so we are also exporting the individual reducers


//Example:
// Suppose state.todos initially looks like this:

// javascript
// Copy code
// state = {
//     todos: [
//         { id: 1, text: "Buy groceries" },
//         { id: 2, text: "Clean the house" }
//     ]
// }
// After state.todos.push(todo); is executed, and todo is:

// javascript
// Copy code
// todo = { id: 3, text: "Learn Redux" }
// The state.todos array will now look like this:

// javascript
// Copy code
// state = {
//     todos: [
//         { id: 1, text: "Buy groceries" },
//         { id: 2, text: "Clean the house" },
//         { id: 3, text: "Learn Redux" } // New todo added to the array
//     ]
// }
// Summary:
// The line state.todos.push(todo); adds a new todo item to the existing list of todos in the Redux state, effectively updating the state by appending the new task to the end of the todos array.
